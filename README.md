*postagga* is a suite of tools that strive to assist you in generating a
simple and embeddable natural langauge processor. With it, you can
provide simple annotated corpora of text as plain Clojure structures,
train a POS Tagger and specify rules for simple phrase structure-based
parsers to drill information from natural text.

*postagga* can be eventually compiled to a self-contained package that
understands free speech (Yeah!) into structured data, and will happily run
where Java and JavaScript can... So you can make real smart bots now!
